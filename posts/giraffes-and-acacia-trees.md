Giraffes and acacia trees share an intricate relationship in African ecosystems. While giraffes are known to be expert leaf consumers, they play an unexpected role in acacia tree survival. When giraffes feed on the lower leaves of acacias, they stimulate the trees to produce toxic chemicals as a defense mechanism. Interestingly, these chemicals not only deter herbivores but also attract ants that provide additional protection. This example of ecological interconnectedness showcases how giraffes influence their habitat in ways beyond just being herbivores.
