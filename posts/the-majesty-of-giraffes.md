Giraffes, those enchanting giants of the savannah, are known for their incredible height, often reaching up to 18 feet. Their long necks, composed of only seven vertebrae like humans, enable them to graze on leaves high up in trees that other animals can't reach. Interestingly, these gentle giants possess hearts that pump blood at an astonishingly high pressure to counteract gravity and prevent fainting when they bend down to drink. Their distinctive spotted coat patterns, as unique as fingerprints, offer camouflage against predators and help them identify each other. Giraffes truly stand tall as marvels of the animal kingdom.
